## Clustering techniques

### Project overview 
We explore various clustering techniques like the Hierarchical clustering and the K- Means clustering and identify the right number of clusters that make the most sense. 

### Navigating through the project, step by step: 

1. We have tried to standardize the data and perform Hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s method.
2. Created dendograms to identify the no. of clusters that would make sense. 
3. We have compared cluster centroids to characterize different clusters and gave each cluster a label—a meaningful name that characterizes the cluster.
4. To check the stability of clusters, we remove a random 5% of the data and see if the clusters are affected by it. 
5. We procede to K-Means clustering.
6. Now we compare the resuls of Hierarchical clusting to that of K-means clustering. 
7. Lastly to address the challenge, we propose solutions by checking which cluster to offer the offers to promote the products.
