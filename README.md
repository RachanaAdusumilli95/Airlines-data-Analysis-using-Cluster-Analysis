## Clustering techniques

### Project overview 
We explore various clustering techniques like the Hierarchical clustering and the K- Means clustering and identify the right number of clusters that make the most sense. 

### Navigating through the project, step by step: 

1. We have tried to standardize the data and perform Hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s method.
2. Created dendograms to identify the no. of clusters that would make sense. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128670789/227756791-0ba27d3b-c9b6-44b9-98c4-711085c47b2f.png)
4. We have compared cluster centroids to characterize different clusters and gave each cluster a label—a meaningful name that characterizes the cluster.
5. To check the stability of clusters, we remove a random 5% of the data and see if the clusters are affected by it. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128670789/227756825-982ce769-17e6-4d05-8a79-d04aee1dac49.png)
6. We procede to K-Means clustering. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128670789/227756851-1757b105-fc9d-4416-abb8-1b1650cd5f0a.png)
7. Now we compare the resuls of Hierarchical clusting to that of K-means clustering. 
8. Lastly to address the challenge, we propose solutions by checking which cluster to offer the offers to promote the products.
