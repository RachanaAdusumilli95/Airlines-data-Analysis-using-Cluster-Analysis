Clustering techniques

### Navigating through the project

In this project we have tried to standardize the data and perform hirearcheal clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s method. The goal is to create dendograms and identify the no. of clusters that would make sense. We have also compared cluster centroids to characterize different clusters and gave each cluster a 
label—a meaningful name that characterizes the cluster.We also check the stability of clusters by removing a random 5% of the data and see if the clusters are affected by it. We then procede to K-Means clustering. We try and compare the resuls of Hirearcheal clusting to that of K-means clustering. Lastly to address the challenge, we propose solutions by checking which cluster to offer the offers to promote the products.
